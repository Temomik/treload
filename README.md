# PyDev.Debugger — Rewritten Fork

This project is a **fully rewritten version** of the original [PyDev.Debugger](https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger), originally developed by Fabio Zadrozny and contributors.

The entire codebase has been restructured to improve clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🧩 **Support for dynamic updates** of next modern Python constructs:
  - `builtins`
  - `@decorators`
  - `properties`
  - `classes`
  - `functions and methods`
- 🧠 Improved internal architecture for easier extension and debugging

## ⚠️ Compatibility

- 🐍 **Currently supports only Python 2.x**
  - Compatibility with Python 3 is planned but not yet implemented
  - Some newer language features may be limited due to interpreter constraints
